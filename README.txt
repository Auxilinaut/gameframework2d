SMO

2D endless runner using SDL2 in C

Clone this repo and run smo.exe to play

Open smo.sln in Visual Studio 2015 or higher, verify VC++ directories (lib/include, SDL2), and verify linker inputs in project settings (SDL2.lib, SDL2main.lib [not in release], SDL2_image.lib, SDL2_mixer.lib, SDL2_ttf.lib).
